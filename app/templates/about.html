			<div>Welcome to Light-Bearer Technologies!</div><br><br>
			<div>I am Chris, a Python developer based in Aberdeen, Scotland.</div>
			<div>This site is home to my projects.</div>
			<div>The frontend uses Bootstrap 5, served by Flask on the back-end.</div>
			<div>I use GitHub as a key part of my site's stack and you can view the repo <a href="https://github.com/Lux-Ferre/lbtech-info">here.</a></div><br><br>
			<div>Most of my learning has been from 
			<a href="https://pythonaberdeen.github.io">APUG</a>, 
			<a href="https://talkpython.fm">podcasts</a>, 
			<a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">my projects</a>, 
			or online sources.</div>
			<div>However, I have found that for some CS principles, reading has been a better source.</div>
			<div>I will try to list some books I have read, and some thoughts on them, <a href="{{ url_for('books') }}">here.</a></div>
