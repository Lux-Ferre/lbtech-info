	<h1>Two of These People Are Lying</h1>
	<p>A WIP app to facilitate playing a version of <a href="https://youtu.be/3UAOs9B9UH8">Technical Difficulties: Two of These People Are Lying.</a></p>
	<p>All but one player enters the title of a Wikipedia article, and the remaining player picks one at random.</p>
	<p>The players are then to describe what the article is about and the chooser is to figure out who actually knows what the article is.</p>
	<p>It will have a login feature to allow for remote players.</p>
	<p>This project doesn't have a publicly accessable page at the moment.</p>
