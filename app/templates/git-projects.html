				<h2>Here I will list projects on GitHub that I have either contributed to or own.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/Lux-Ferre/lbtech-info">lbtech-info</a>
				<p>The repo that contains this website. Changes are pushed to the repo from whichever device I'm using. The repo is then used to update the VPS hosting the site.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group">Aberdeen Python User Group</a>
				<p>The Aberdeen Python User Group repo. This is a monthly meetup involving a presentation followed by code challenges. Solutions to said challenges are submitted via PR.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/Lux-Ferre/galaxy-builder">Galaxy Builder</a>
				<p>A software project that's part of a larger project.</p>
				<p>The galaxy builder is designed to assist in the world building for a table top RPG universe.</p>
				<p>The core feature is the ability to create celestial bodies with either randomized, or user created inputs.</p>
				<p>As part of the randomization feature, there is a sub-script that accesses the ESA's Gaia API to make some of the randomization more statistically accurate.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods">the_od_bods</a>
				<p>An open-source, automated directory of Scotland's open data available at <a href="opendata.scot">OpenData.scot</a></p>
				<p>This fantastic project brings together Scotland's disparate and inconveniently located data sets into a single, clean, searchable location.</p>
				<p>My contribution here was to resolve an issue involving the inclusion of National Library of Scotland data.</p>
				<p>Since they didn't have an API, the solution was to build a scraper.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/Lux-Ferre/wall-map">wall-map</a>
				<p>An experiment in procedural generation and sister project to the galaxy-builder.</p>
				<p>Uses Perlin noise layers to create a procedural topographical map.</p>
				<p>CUDA GPU acceleration brought the time down from an hour to seconds per run.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="https://github.com/CodeTheCity/ctc21_nautical_wrecks">CTC21 - Nautical Wrecks</a>
				<p>Another open source project.</p>
				<p>Here, I worked with 2 others to find a data source of wrecks off the coasts of Scotland and incorporate the information into WikiData.</p>
				<p>I took the lead on writing the scraping and cleaning software while my collegues navigated the issue of finding a source with an open license.</p>
				<p>Together, we looked through the data to decide how to clean it before it was automatically uploaded to WikiData with the help of Ian.</p>
